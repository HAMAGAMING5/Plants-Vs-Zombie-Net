#PlantsVsZombies.net
Description
An opensource cross-platform Plants Vs Zombies remake, written in C#, originated from codes in an olde-mobile version.

Software Architecture
The whole project comprises of three parts, which are Lawn, Sexy, and Sexy.TodLib. Lawn contains the very mechanic of the game system, including picking and spawning zombies, setting on the shooter plants, etc. Sexy works as the intermediate layer between the top-level of the game and XNA framework, providing several managers which help to control multimedia resources, and basic UI widgets. Sexy.TodLib controls of the rendering of graphic FXs.

Installation
Clone into local;
Compile with VS2022 (or 2019);
Extract game contents (not included in this repo) into the path of the compiled executable;
Enjoy!
Instructions
